## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about using Flexbox and Grid for layout management during this challenge. Additionally, I practised adding hover and focus states to improve user experience.

Hereâ€™s an example of a hover effect I applied:

```css
button:hover {
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue working on improving my CSS animations and responsiveness. I also want to explore more about accessibility features.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - My go-to resource for understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Helped me better understand Flexbox and Grid layouts.
